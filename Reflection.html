  <p> This Course taught us about many different IST relevant subjects. We learned about things like binary and went onto coding in minecraft and code hs. Beofre learning how to operate the Linux and code through it</p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p> Binary was the first thing we learned it is the language that computers operate in. It operates much differently than any other language as it does it through only numbers 0 and 1</p>

  <br> 
  <p> Than we went on to learning some of Karel in Javascript this is a pretty basic way but you will tell a dog how to move and teaches you the logic and core principals of java script</p>

  <br>
  <p>Than we went on to Linux and the virtual boxes which is the unit we spent by fr the most time on. We learned how to set up a virtual box and use the command line thorugh it. Later on we learned how  to set up git through it and also use the VSCODE on it.</p>
